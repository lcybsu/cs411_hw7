# cs411_hw7
This project is to construct a minimum spanning tree using Prim's algorithm.

prim_firstMethod.cpp has a time complexity of O(n^2). 
prim_secondMethod.cpp has a time complexity of O(#edge log(#vertices)) using priority_queue in STL. 

Run the program and enter the graph setting following the instruction.
